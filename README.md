# [LZW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel–Ziv–Welch)
Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) is a universal lossless data compression algorithm created by Abraham Lempel, Jacob Ziv, and Terry Welch. It is the algorithm of the widely used Unix file compression utility [Compress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compress), and is widely used in the [GIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF) image format.

Uses a [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) testing suite, with test cases found in `test/test.cpp`.

# Usage
One can run all test cases by running:
```
make
./test_suite
```
